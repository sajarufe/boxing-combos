Write a Javascript function to generate random boxing combinations. The combinations should include the standard punches (1 to 6) and the following defensive moves: slip right (SR), slip left (SL), roll right (RR), roll left (RL), lean (L). The combinations should alternate left and right moves, except for the jab which may be repeated but only once. In terms of sides, a right defense is equivalent to a left punch. The lean defense has no side and can be included anywhere in the combo. Finally, punches should be twice as frequent as defenses.
